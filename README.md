# pacmen

## Title of the project
pacmen

## Description of the project
Create a pacman on demand (button click) and move these pacmen across the page.

Here's how the game is played:

When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen.
When you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman or pacmen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.

## How to Run
Load index.html in a browser with pacmen.js in same dir and an images dir that holds the pacmen image files.

## Roadmap of future improvements
* Let people specify number of pacmen rather than click a button for each.
